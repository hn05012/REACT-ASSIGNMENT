# REACT-ASSIGNMENT

## Project Overview

This project involved refactoring an existing React application to enhance code quality, maintainability, and performance. The primary focus was to adhere to React best practices without altering the application's functionality or structure.

## Key Refactoring Improvements

- **State Management Optimization**: Replaced global state management with localized state using `useState` hooks within components to improve encapsulation and readability.

- **Event Handler Optimization**: Implemented `useCallback` hooks for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders and enhance performance.

- **TypeScript Enhancements**: Updated and refined TypeScript types to ensure type safety and improve developer experience.

- **Code Quality Improvements**: Removed anti-patterns and improved code structure for better maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.

- **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience.

- **ESLint**: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code.
